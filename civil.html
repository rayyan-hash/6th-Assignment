        <h1>Civil War</h1>

    <p>The Civil War, also known as the American Civil War or the War of the States, took place from 1861 to 1865, between the Union and the Confederate States of America. It resulted in the end of the Cold War and the American Revolutionary War.</p>

         A civil war is often a high-intensity conflict, often involving regular armed forces, that is sustained, organized and large-scale. Civil wars may result in large numbers of casualties and the consumption of significant resources.[5]

            The Civil War has had a profound impact on American history, shaping the course of the nation's development and the American Revolutionary War. The war has also contributed to the establishment of the United States Constitution and the formation of the Union and Confederate States of America.

            Civil wars since the end of World War II have lasted on average just over four years, a dramatic rise from the one-and-a-half-year average of the 1900â€“1944 period. While the rate of emergence of new civil wars has been relatively steady since the mid-19th century, the increasing length of those wars has resulted in increasing numbers of wars ongoing at any one time. For example, there were no more than five civil wars underway simultaneously in the first half of the 20th century while there were over 20 concurrent civil wars close to the end of the Cold War. Since 1945, civil wars have resulted in the deaths of over 25 million people, as well as the forced displacement of millions more. Civil wars have further resulted in economic collapse; Somalia, Burma (Myanmar), Uganda and Angola are examples of nations that were considered to have had promising futures before being engulfed in civil wars.[6]
