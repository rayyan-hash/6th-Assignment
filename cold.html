    <p>
        The Cold War, also known as the Cold War of World War II, was a global conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union that lasted from 1947 to 1991. It was a period of significant geopolitical tension, political instability, and economic conflict that resulted in widespread disarray and the end of World War II.
        The Cold War was a period of global geopolitical tension and struggle for ideological and economic influence between the United States and the Soviet Union (USSR) and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc, that started in 1947, two years after the end of World War II, and lasted until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The term cold war is used because there was no direct fighting between the two superpowers, though each supported opposing sides in major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. Aside from the nuclear arms race starting in 1949 and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed indirectly via psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, sports diplomacy, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.
        The Cold War resulted in the creation of numerous military alliances, including the United Nations (UN), NATO, and the Warsaw Pact, as well as the development of the United States' military, economy, and diplomatic policies. The Cold War also led to the creation of the Cold War Communist Party (CCP) and the Cold War Communist Regime (CCR)
