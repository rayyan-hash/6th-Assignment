                    Ancient wars, also known as antiquity wars, are wars that occurred before the development of written language. They include conflicts between tribes, civilizations, or groups within a single society. Examples include the Macedonian War (481-447 BC), the Trojan War (539-527 BC), and the Persian Wars (526-499 BC).
                    Ancient warfare is war that was conducted from the beginning of recorded history to the end of the ancient period. The difference between prehistoric and ancient warfare is more organization oriented than technology oriented. The development of first city-states, and then empires, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in Mesopotamia, states produced sufficient agricultural surplus. This allowed full-time ruling elites and military commanders to emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could portion off each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time. These new armies were able to help states grow in size and become increasingly centralized.

                        Modern wars, also known as contemporary wars, involve conflicts between nations, states, or even individual citizens. Examples include the Cold War, the ongoing geopolitical conflicts between the United States and China, and the ongoing conflicts between the United States and Russia.
                        The Cold War, which lasted from 1947 to 1991, is a period of significant geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union.

                            Modern wars are characterized by the extensive use of advanced technology, including sophisticated weaponry, communication systems, intelligence gathering, and cyber warfare, often resulting in large-scale civilian casualties and complex geopolitical dynamics; some prominent examples include: World War II, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the War on Terror, and the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine which showcase the evolving nature of modern combat with features like drone strikes, information manipulation, and hybrid warfare strategies.
